It's been a month since i have been learning NodeJS and from past one week I have been making a server health check using pure NodeJS (Without NPM) !

Github link : [Click here to see the GitHub repo]{:target="_blank"}

I have used callback pattern to implement it ü§®

##### What does it do üßê ?
In short it just pings the server and get the status and notifies the user in case of any change in the status code. Here is how its done.

<br>

**Users** \
Each users can have max 5 checks and in case of any change in status code users can be notified using twillio sms API.

<br>

**Tokens** \
Creation of session tokens for the users when they login \
It can be used to: 
* Update, delete user.
* Add, update, delete checks.
* Extend token validity.

<br>

**Checks** \
Each check consist of:
* Website URL
* Protocol (http/https)
* Required status code
* Method
* Timeout Seconds

<br>

All the data is stored locally in json form and time period can be set for compressing the logs
