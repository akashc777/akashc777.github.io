I made this project during a course (Udacity BLockchain Nanodegree). I did the course because it was for free if I complete it within 30 days which I was able to do it ðŸ¥³.

I created custom ERC721 token for this project and used the following tech:

**Truffle:** I used [truffle webpack]{:target="_blank"} to skip writting boilerplate code. It is super useful comes with sample artifacts and also with some web3 code. Which made the project development much faster and easier.

**Infura:** It's a super usefull tool if you want to develop for ethereum blockchain since it saves all the toruble of downloading the complete chain to your machine and it becomes a api call. It will save lot of space in your machine.

**Opensea:** Opensea is like amazon in which we can sell/buy goods using digital tokens like ethereum. I used opensea so that exchange can happen with my custom ERC721 token. Its a good platform to test your tokens on ethereum blockchain.

Also used metamask for web3 injection ðŸ˜œ.
